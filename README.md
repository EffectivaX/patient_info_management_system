# Patient-Information-Management-System
This project was birthed from a Hacakthon I attended in Victoria Falls 2019. There were a number of ideas that people were working on. After the hackathon,
one group that did not have a developer asked me if I could build a Patients Information Management System. I proceeded and did so.
